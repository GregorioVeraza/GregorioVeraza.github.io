## My process

## - Built with
- HTML
- CSS Grid

## What I learned building this project

I learned about:
- Basic HTML things like how to use a div, link the HTML to a CSS file, insert an image, etcetera.
- Basic CSS things like how to use a grid template using grid-template-area. I decided to use it instead of flexbox because the main div was splitted in three parts, where the first area was for the qr, the second one was for the main text and the last one was for the subtitle.
- How to deploy my project using GitHub Pages.
