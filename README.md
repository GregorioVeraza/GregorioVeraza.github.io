## What I learned building this project

During this project, I learned:

- How to structure a simple HTML page using `div` elements, link a CSS file, and insert an image.
- How to use **CSS Grid**, especially `grid-template-areas`, which I chose over Flexbox because the layout was divided into three distinct areas: the QR image, the main text, and the subtitle.
- How to deploy a static site using **GitHub Pages**.
